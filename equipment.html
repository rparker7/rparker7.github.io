<div class="text">I started out using a Pentax 35 mm film camera.  As digital photography became a reality and I started a family, I primarily used point and shot or compact DSLRs with a fixed lens.  These include Canon and Fujifilm cameras.  As mirrorless cameras have been developed and my family has started to explore more of the county, I started to research DSLRs and mirrorless camera options.  Based upon my needs and price I decided to purchase a Nikon Z50 with two lens kit.  The bottom line for me this was a good balance between price, technology, sensor size, and quality.</div>
