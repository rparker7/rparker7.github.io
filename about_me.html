<div class="instructions">Why I like Photography</div> 
	
<div class="text">
	My first expereince with photography was when I traveled to Ireland with family friends as a teenager.
	My parents let me take a Pentax 35 mm camera with two lenses.  The only thing I knew about the camera 
	was how to load the film and that the dot on the light meter should be in the middle.  However, I was
	hooked on looking for that perfect picture and then waiting for the film to be developed to see if it
	turned out.  Photography was something that I enjoyed becuase it helped perserve moements and capture 
	the beauty of things.  Initially, my skills really didn't expand beyond the basics of point and shoot.
	However, photography was something my nw wife also really enjoyed.  Her level of expertise far surpassed
	mine which encouraged me to increase my skills.  As photography moved from film to digital the ability 
	to practice and experiment with taking photographs increased.  Trial and error became a great teacher.
	My photography skills and knowledge of basic concepts increased when I took a photography calss through
	the local community college.  These skills were further enchanced when I became a crime scene agent at
	work.  With each picture I take, my proficiency and skills increase.
	<br>
	<br>
	As my wife and I have traveled and two childrend have come into our lives, thenumber of pictures that 
	I have taken has increased dramatically.  One of the greates pleasures is looking back through pictures
	which trigger the memories and feelings of those moments.  Using these photographs to create 
	album/photobooks has been a greate way to link photographs and memories.  
	<br>
	<br>
	As my family and I have grown older I am looking forward to combining photography with hiking and 
	traveling.  I have also begun exploring the post-production process using Adodbe Lightroom.
